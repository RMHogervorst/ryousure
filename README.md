# ryousure
a set of functions that help you in writing blog posts about R, libaries in brackets, functions in backticks etc

It would be cool if I was a bit more consistent in naming things in blogposts. 
So Ideally I would like something like spellcheck for blogposts, the parser would go through a rmd file and suggest
and or correct things like:

* when you refer to a library use {libary name}  example {dplyr}
* when you refer to a function use backticks `select`
